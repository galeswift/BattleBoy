BattleBoy
=========

BattleBoy.  This is a clone of a popular SC2 custom map called BattleCraft.  Our goals were to mostly make the same game, however we wanted to add coop against AI, multiple levels, and some similar gameplay to a tower defense/horde mode.

Everything is built on the 2d boy rapid prototyping framework, with Raknet for multiplayer support.
